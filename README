This is a simulation of [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). Basic cellular automata.

P.S: Old code. Please don't judge :yum:
#### To launch the simulation :
`python launch.py`

External libraries needed - pygame and wxwidgets. For debian based distros (includes ubuntu):
`sudo apt-get install python-pygame python-wxtools`

### Some info
There are 2 modes - continous and non-continous

In the non-continous mode, the user is required to input the initial configuration of live cells by clicking the cells with 
the mouse. To advance to the next turn, press the right mouse button

In the continous mode, the is again required to input the initial configuration using the mouse. But when the user presses the
right mouse button, the system advances continously to reach a stable state or the dead state. To stop/restart the simulation, the windows should be closed
and started again (for the time being).


To Do :

1. Better menu's. The GUI is, to put it mildly, uninspiring
2. Smoother user input. Click and drag should populate multiple cells in one go
3. Ability to tamper with intermediate states - clicking on a live cell should make it dead in the non-continous mode
