This is a simulation of Conway's game of life. Basic cellular automata.

To launch the simulation :
python launch.py

External libraries needed: pygame and wxwidgets :
sudo apt-get install python-pygame python-wxtools

There are 2 modes - continous and non-continous

In the non-continous mode, the user is required to input the initial configuration of live cells by clicking the cells with 
the mouse. To advance to the next turn, press the right mouse button

In the continous mode, the is again required to input the initial configuration using the mouse. But when the user presses the
right mouse button, the system advances continously to reach a stable state or the dead state. To stop/restart the simulation, the windows should be closed
and started again.


To Do :

1. Better menu's. The GUI is uninspiring
2. The user input is buggy. Sometimes you have to click a cell twice or thrice to make it alive. Instead of this, just clicking and dragging
the mouse should result in easy live cell creation
3. Clicking on a live cell should make it dead in the non-continous mode
